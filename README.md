## 📱 **Calculate Tip - A Simple React App**

**Calculate Tip** is a user-friendly web application that helps users quickly calculate tips based on the bill amount and the desired tip percentage. It features dynamic calculations, input validation with regular expressions (regex), and a reset button to quickly start over.

### 🔧 **Built with:**

* **React** for a fast, interactive UI.
* **State Management** with React's built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
* **CSS** for styling the components and making the app look clean and responsive.
* **Regex Validation** for ensuring valid numeric input for both the bill total and the number of people to split the bill.

### 💡 **Features:**

* **Dynamic Tip Calculation**: As users change the bill amount or tip percentage, the tip amount and total bill are updated instantly.
* **Customizable Tip Percentage**: Choose from predefined percentages (10%, 15%, 20%, 25%) or input your own custom tip amount.
* **Responsive Design**: The app looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.
* **Input Validation**: Uses regular expressions to validate user input for the bill and the number of people to split the bill. Invalid inputs show an error message, prompting the user to enter only numbers.
* **Reset Button**: A simple button to clear all inputs (bill, tip percentage, and split count) to start fresh with default values.

4. **Calculation**: The app instantly calculates the tip amount and the total per person.
